This is a friendly personal blog that will allow Internet users to get to know my casual side. If you are looking to work with me, I kindly suggest you follow the link to [my Linkedin profile](http://linkedin.com/in/{{linkedin_username}})

I was born in 1997 (the year Kasparov lost to IBM Deep Blue). I spent my early adolescence playing World of Warcraft. My interest in computers started to develop when 12 year old me created a Counter-Strike server "brand" together with an internet friend. The servers needed a website, publicity and custom mods which is how I entered into the world of HTML, CSS, Javascript, SEO, etc. I started getting requests from relatives and friends of relatives for "low cost websites" which I happily accepted. Looking to connect with like-minded individuals, I went to a high school that focused on mathematics. There I came in contact with Algorithms and Data Structures and generally did a lot of programming-related extracurricula. I deepened my knowledge of Linux, which I had come in contact with during my CS server days and I made my own distributions based on [Arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux), [LFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_From_Scratch) and [TCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Core_Linux). At university (TU Berlin)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Berlin] I came in contact with Finance, Database technologies and Data Science.

The boring, slow-paced English courses my parents made me go to could not break my love for languages. I love learning new words, because my brain seems to have developed a trick for doing it. For most of the interesting words I've learned since adolescence, I can remember the time, place and how I felt when I learned the word. Finding out about obscure etymology connections between words also strengthens my memory. I became passionate for Phonology and Phonetics when I landed in Berlin and realized no body could understand a word I said.
